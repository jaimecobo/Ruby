=begin
	A block is some lines of code that are ready to be executed. 
	The lines can either be defined by being enclosed in curly braces, 
	just as you saw in the above example, or you can use words do and end when working with multi-line operations. 
	For example:
=end

.times do
 puts "This is a code block!"
end
